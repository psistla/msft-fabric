# Microsoft Fabric Data Analytics Security Framework

## Overview

Microsoft Fabric provides a unified analytics platform with a unified Software as a Service (SaaS) experience, a unified billing model, and a lake centric, open, and AI powered framework that is secure and governed by default. This comprehensive security framework extends the general data analytics security principles specifically for Microsoft Fabric implementations.

## 1. Fabric Platform Security Architecture

### OneLake Security Foundation
- **Single Data Lake**: OneLake serves as the centralized data repository with unified security policies
- **Azure Active Directory Integration**: Native AAD integration for identity and access management
- **Workspace-Level Security**: Hierarchical security model with workspace, capacity, and tenant controls
- **Cross-Service Security**: Consistent security policies across Data Factory, Synapse, Power BI, and other Fabric services

### Capacity and Licensing Security
- **Fabric Capacity Management**: Security policies applied at capacity level (F2, F4, F8, etc.)
- **SKU-Based Feature Access**: Copilot and AI features are rolling out to all paid SKUs, starting from F2 and above
- **Tenant-Level Governance**: Enterprise-wide security policies and compliance controls
- **Resource Isolation**: Dedicated compute resources for sensitive workloads

### Multi-Service Integration Security
- **Unified Authentication**: Single sign-on across all Fabric services
- **Cross-Service Permissions**: Granular access control between Data Factory, Synapse, Power BI components
- **Service Principal Management**: Automated workflows with secure service accounts
- **API Gateway Security**: Centralized API access control and monitoring

## 2. Data Source Security in Fabric

### Data Factory Security
- **Gateway Management**: On-premises data gateway with certificate-based authentication
- **Connection Security**: Encrypted connections to cloud and on-premises data sources
- **Credential Management**: Azure Key Vault integration for storing connection credentials
- **Pipeline Security**: Secure data movement with activity-level permissions
- **Dataflow Gen2 Security**: Enhanced security for data transformation workflows

### Real-Time Intelligence Security
- **Event Stream Security**: Secure ingestion from Kafka, Event Hubs, and IoT sources
- **KQL Database Security**: Query-level access control and data masking
- **Stream Processing Security**: Real-time data transformation with security policies
- **Alert and Monitoring**: Real-time security event detection and response

### Data Lakehouse Security
- **Delta Lake Security**: ACID transactions with row-level and column-level security
- **Spark Security**: Secure distributed processing with isolation controls
- **Notebook Security**: Code execution security and secret management
- **File-Level Permissions**: Granular access control on lakehouse files and folders

## 3. Data Warehouse Security Features

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
Row-level security (RLS) enables you to use group membership or execution context to control access to rows in a database table. Key implementation details:

**Predicate-Based Security**:
```sql
-- Creating schema for Security
CREATE SCHEMA Security;
GO

-- Creating a function for the SalesRep evaluation
CREATE FUNCTION Security.tvf_securitypredicate(@SalesRep AS nvarchar(50))
RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
RETURN SELECT 1 AS tvf_securitypredicate_result
WHERE @SalesRep = USER_NAME() OR USER_NAME() = 'manager@contoso.com';
GO

-- Using the function to create a Security Policy
CREATE SECURITY POLICY SalesFilter
ADD FILTER PREDICATE Security.tvf_securitypredicate(SalesRep)
ON sales.Orders
WITH (STATE = ON);
```

**RLS Behavior**:
- Filter predicates silently filter the rows available to read operations
- The access restriction logic is in the database tier, not in any single application tier
- Row-level security only applies to queries on a Warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint in Fabric. Power BI queries on a warehouse in Direct Lake mode will fall back to Direct Query mode to abide by row-level security

### Column-Level Security (CLS)
Column-Level and Row-Level Security in Fabric Warehouse & SQL Endpoint in Public preview provides:
- **Data Masking**: Dynamic data masking prevents unauthorized viewing of sensitive data by using masks to prevent access to complete, such as email addresses or numbers
- **Column Permissions**: Granular access control on specific columns
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Automated classification and protection of PII and sensitive data

### T-SQL Security Features
- **Security Policies**: CREATE SECURITY POLICY statements for access control
- **Inline Table-Valued Functions**: Custom security predicates
- **Schema Binding**: Performance optimization with SCHEMABINDING = ON
- **Permission Management**: ALTER ANY SECURITY POLICY and schema-level permissions

## 4. Power BI Security Integration

### Semantic Model Security
- **Dataset-Level Security**: Access control on semantic models and datasets
- **RLS Integration**: Limitations include expressions that today can only be defined using DAX including dynamic rules such as username() or userprincipalname()
- **Dynamic Security**: DAX-based security expressions for flexible access control
- **Report-Level Security**: Granular permissions on reports and dashboards

### Direct Lake Mode Security
- **Performance Optimization**: Direct access to OneLake with security enforcement
- **Fallback to DirectQuery**: Automatic fallback when RLS is applied
- **Real-Time Data Access**: Secure access to live data without data movement
- **Composite Model Security**: Security across multiple data sources

### Workspace Security
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer roles
- **App Security**: Secure distribution of Power BI apps
- **Sharing Permissions**: Granular sharing controls with expiration dates
- **External Sharing**: B2B collaboration with guest user management

## 5. Data Science and AI Security

### Machine Learning Security
- **MLflow Integration**: Secure model versioning and deployment
- **Experiment Security**: Access control on ML experiments and runs

### Notebook Security
- **Code Execution Control**: Secure Spark and Python execution environments
- **Secret Management**: Integration with Azure Key Vault for credentials
- **Library Management**: Secure package installation and dependency management
- **Collaboration Security**: Secure notebook sharing and version control

## 6. Current Limitations and Challenges

### Row-Level Security Limitations

**DAX Expression Limitations**:
- Limitations include expressions that today can only be defined using DAX including dynamic rules such as username() or userprincipalname()
- Complex business logic requires DAX expertise
- Limited support for complex joins in security predicates

**Performance Impact**:
- RLS can impact query performance, especially with complex predicates
- Power BI queries on a warehouse in Direct Lake mode will fall back to Direct Query mode to abide by row-level security
- Memory overhead for maintaining security context

**Cross-Service Consistency**:
- RLS implementation varies between Warehouse, SQL Endpoint, and Power BI
- Security policies must be managed separately across services
- Limited cross-service security inheritance

### Data Governance Challenges

**Multi-Workspace Security**:
- Complex permission management across multiple workspaces
- Inconsistent security policies between workspaces
- Difficulty in enterprise-wide policy enforcement

**OneLake Security Granularity**:
- File-level permissions may not provide sufficient granularity
- Limited support for complex data lineage security
- Challenges with nested folder permission inheritance

**Real-Time Security**:
- Streaming data security policies are complex to implement
- Limited support for dynamic security in real-time scenarios
- Event-driven security policy updates not fully supported

### Integration and Migration Challenges

**Legacy System Integration**:
- Complex integration with existing on-premises security systems
- Limited support for custom authentication providers
- Challenges with hybrid cloud-on-premises security policies

**Migration Complexity**:
- Synapse schema conversion to Fabric's format may introduce security gaps
- Data migration security validation requirements
- Maintaining security during phased migrations

**Compliance and Auditing**:
- Limited built-in compliance reporting
- Complex audit trail management across multiple services
- Challenges with data residency and sovereignty requirements
